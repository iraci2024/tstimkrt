* Changes in v9.50
---------------------------------------------------------

*** !! READ BEFORE UPDATING !! ***************************************************************
We are cleaning up the RealThinClient SDK, to make it more light-weight and easier to maintain.
As part of this clean-up process, units and/or components which we NO LONGER PLAN TO MAINTAIN
OR SUPPORT (DEPRECATE) are being moved to a new "Legacy" folder. If you are still using any 
of these units or components (see list below) and want to continue using them after this update,
in addition to installing the packages you want from the "Legacy\SDKPackages_Legacy.bpg" Group,
update your Delphi's Library Search Path to include the new "Legacy" folder (as well as "Lib").
