---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.36 (2014.Q2)
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "AddHostToChannel", "AddListenerToChannel", "AddUserToChannel" and "RemoveUserFromChannel" methods 
   added to the "TRtcGateway" component to make it easy to manage Groups of Hosts and Listeners in Channels.
   Users can be Hosts and/or Listeners on any number of Channels. Hosts can get notified about Listeners,
   and Listeners can get notified about Hosts joining and leaving their Channels. Notifications are being 
   sent in form of Group notifications when users are leaving or joining the Group specified for each User.

2) GateChatServer Demo updated to use the new "AddUserToChannel" and "RemoveUserFromChannel" methods
   from the "TRtcGateway" component, instead of manually implementing Group notifications. Even though 
   only one channel is used for all Users in this example (channel:"Chat"), this example shows how all
   users can get notified about other users connecting to the Gateway and disconnecting from the Gateway
   by using Group messages through the new "AddUserToChannel" and "RemoveUserFromChannel" methods.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.35
---------------------------------------------------------

1) "SetClient" method on the "TRtcAbsGateClientLink" class made virtual.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.34
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Request and Response Cookie delimiter is now set to ";" by default, 
   instead of scanning the Cookie Text guessing the delimiter. 
   If your Cookies are using a different delimiter, use the "Cookie.Delimiter" 
   property to change it before accessing Cookie values by name.

2) Fixed Timeouts on the TRtcGateClient component to correctly disconnect the 
   Client from the Gateway in case of long communication delays.

3) StreamSec Mobile Plugins added to the "LibPlugins" folder.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.33
---------------------------------------------------------

1) RAD Studio XE6 compatibility update.

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes in v6.32
---------------------------------------------------------

1) TRtcDataRouter and TRtcLoadBalancer components updated for SSL support using 3rd-party encryption components.

2) LoadBalancer3 Demo extended with SSL encryption support (using StreamSec Tools 2.1)

3) BrowserUpload QuickStart example extended with SSL encryption support (using StreamSec Tools 2.1)
