!!IMPORTANT!! In the RTC SDK v9.00 update, some breaking changes were introduced.
If you are updating from any older RTC SDK version (v6.x, v7.x or v8.x), read the
"Updates_v900_2017Q4.txt" file if you get any compile errors in your Project(s)!

---------------------------------------------------------
* Changes between v9.21 and v9.25 (2018.Q2)
---------------------------------------------------------

1. "TRtcHttpValues" class in the "rtcInfo.pas" unit was extended with a new 
   "ItemIndex" property and a new "GetAsStream" method, and .. the "TRtcHttpHeader" 
   class (also in the "rtcInfo.pas" unit) was extended with the "ItemIndex" property.

2. "TRtcHttpValues" class was updated to support content larger than 2 GB 
   in size, and ... the "GetFile" method used to copy content into a "TStream"
   was optimized to minimize memory usage when retrieving large files.
   
3. "GetTempFile" function in the "rtcSystem.pas" unit was extended to support
   the use of a custom-defined TEMP folder (defined in the new global variable 
   "RTC_DEFAULT_TEMP_FOLDER", set to '' by default) when creating temporary files, 
   using a GUID instead of the "GetTempFileName" API to get a unique file name.
   NOTE: If the "RTC_DEFAULT_TEMP_FOLDER" variable is empty (default), the
   previous implementation (using the OS-specific TEMP folder) will be used.

4. Added checks for the "Size" parameter in "Read_File" and "Read_FileEx" functions,
   to avoid range-check errors at runtime if the function was called with "Size=0"
   (in which case the function would now simply return an empty String/Array).
	
5. Fixed a compile error in the "rtcThrPool.pas" unit when RTTI is enabled.

6. Added an overloaded "Mime_DecodeEx" function to the "rtcSystem" unit, accepting a 
   String as a parameter, to simplify converting Base64-encoded Strings to Byte Arrays.
